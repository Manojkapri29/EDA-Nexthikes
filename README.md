Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Real Estate Pricing
Unveiling the Dynamics of House Valuation in a Dynamic Market
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze real estate pricing data to identify key factors that influence house valuations. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that impact property pricing. The analysis provides insights for a real estate company to make data-driven decisions on property acquisition, sales, and pricing strategies.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains key attributes related to house pricing, including:

Location: City or neighborhood of the property.
Size: Square footage of the house.
Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms: Determines house capacity.
Market Trends: Historical pricing fluctuations.
Amenities: Features like swimming pools, garages, etc.
Economic Indicators: External factors influencing property values.
Data Source
The dataset is named Housing Data.csv and contains real-world real estate pricing information.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps
1. Data Loading and Inspection
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Check for missing values and data types.
Display summary statistics (.describe() and .info()).
2. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values using mean imputation for numerical columns and mode imputation for categorical columns.
Remove duplicate records and fix data anomalies.
3. Univariate Analysis
Understand the distribution of house prices and other key attributes using:
Histograms
Kernel Density Plots (KDE)
Boxplots to detect outliers
4. Multivariate Analysis
Identify relationships between variables using:
Scatter plots (e.g., Price vs. Square Footage)
Correlation Heatmap to analyze feature dependencies
5. Feature Engineering
Create new variables like price per square foot and property age.
Encode categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
6. Handling Outliers
Detect and treat outliers using Interquartile Range (IQR) and Z-score method.
Cap extreme values to prevent skewing analysis.
7. Market Trends and Historical Pricing
Analyze price fluctuations over time using Time-Series Visualizations.
8. Customer Preferences and Amenities
Examine how specific features (like swimming pools, parking spaces) impact pricing.
Cluster houses with similar amenity profiles to understand market segments.
Technologies Used
Python for data analysis
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn for feature scaling and preprocessing
This project provides actionable insights for real estate pricing, identifying key factors that influence house valuations. Through data wrangling, visualization, and feature engineering, we uncover trends that can optimize property pricing strategies.
